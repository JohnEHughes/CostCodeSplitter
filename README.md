# CostCodeSplitter
Simple program that takes a user amount and returns amounts to apportion to specific schedules

Part of my day job is the management of a large service charge budget. The budget is made up of 6 different schedules which are broken down into thirty plus expense codes.
To complicate matters further, when I am raising a PO for a transaction, the amount needs to be apportioned to specific schedules that are different per code, and then apportioned again on unique percentages split across them.
To help facilitate this process, I developed this program which will do these calculations for me straight away.

Not a very interesting program but again, helped me practice programming fundamentals.
